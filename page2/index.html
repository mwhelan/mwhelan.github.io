        <p>When I was planning a git work flow for my Sandra.Snow blog, which is hosted on GitHub Pages, I expected that I would store the project files in the master branch, then publish the site to the gh-pages branch. The point I overlooked is that this is the work flow for project sites, but user and organisation sites, like my blog, work slightly differently. With user and organisation sites you publish the website content to the master branch of your GitHub repository. This was far from ideal, as it meant that my content was mixed with the generated output. Even the slightest tweak to a post would lead to the whole site being generated, meaning monster commits and hiding the changes to the content. I suspect Sandra.Snow has a few solutions to this problem, but here is the solution I came up with.</p>

        <p>When using Node Package Manager (NPM) on Windows, it has an annoying habit of creating massively nested <code>node_modules</code> folders that exceed the 260 character path length limit. This makes it extremely painful to try to delete and causes problems with most windows tools. In Visual Studio, for example, I cannot <code>Refresh Folder</code> when I am in a website project (as opposed to a web application project).</p>

<p>Fortunately, the fix is pretty simple.</p>

        <p>When I moved my blog to <a href="https://github.com/Sandra/Sandra.Snow/wiki">Snow</a> I was lucky that it had a pretty nice theme out of the box - it is the same one that its creator <a href="http://www.philliphaydon.com/">Phillip Haydon</a> uses on his blog. I have been doing a lot of front-end work lately though and I have some pretty strong preferences when I read blogs, so I couldn't resist the urge to style it up just the way I like it. </p>

<p>The theme uses Bootstrap 3 and is fully responsive. Actually, I had a bit of a problem with it displaying on my iPhone. First it would display some posts half width, then it was cutting off the sides. I discovered that the key is in the viewport setting. It seems it's not sufficient to set the viewport to <code>device-width</code>. You also have to set the <code>initial-scale</code> and the <code>maximum-scale</code>.</p>

        <p>Although AngularJS is a JavaScript framework, there is actually quite a lot you can do without writing any JavaScript at all. In my first look at Angular, I am going to focus on simple data binding with Angular directives. Directives are a mechanism that Angular uses to extend the capabilities of HTML. HTML is designed for static documents and directives help you extend it for dynamic views, letting you invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application.</p>

        <p>Before getting into any AngularJS, the first project on Thinkful's Angular course is to create a JavaScript calculator to review front end basics with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It provides some interesting challenges. You can see my working version <a href="http://www.michael-whelan.net/thinkful-angular-adder-subtractor/">here</a>. The source code is also on <a href="https://github.com/mwhelan/thinkful-angular-adder-subtractor">GitHub</a>. </p>

        <p>AngularJS seems to be getting a lot of momentum at the moment and I think it is going to be a really useful thing to know. We have several “meet up” groups for it here in London and I’ve noticed a lot more jobs requiring it. I am currently learning Angular through <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>. I <a href="http://www.michael-whelan.net/doing-fewd-with-thinkful/">blogged recently</a> about the great experience I had with their Front-End Web Development course, and I'm already impressed with the depth of coverage of this course. It doesn’t just cover Angular, but also gets into testing – something I am a huge fan of – and build tools like Gulp and Bower.</p>

<p>I normally blog about C# and things I have a lot of experience with but I thought it might be interesting to blog about AngularJS while I am learning it. All the code I write for the course will be on GitHub so why not try to learn in the open?</p>

        <p>Most of my work has involved ASP.Net MVC and SQL Server, so it seemed natural to gravitate towards blogging platforms that used those technologies. Initially, I used <a href="http://nblog.codeplex.com/">NBlog</a>, which was a great little blogging engine, then I moved to <a href="http://www.funnelweblog.com/">FunnelWeb</a>, which seemed to have a larger community around it and was used by people I knew. My work has expanded a bit to other technologies, such as RavenDB and AngularJS, and I’ve become more open to the idea of using my blog to experiment with new technologies and approaches. I have noticed more and more people moving towards static site generators, and the simplicity really appealed . I also use Git and GitHub a lot more now and the idea of a blog publishing workflow involving Git makes a lot of sense to me. Add in GitHub Pages for free hosting and what could be better?</p>

Solving the database publishing problem felt like <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx">yak shaving</a> so, in the interest of pragmatism and getting back to the task at hand, I decided to just migrate my local SQL Server 14 LocalDb instance to Azure using SQL Server 2014 Management Studio (SSMS). </p>

        <p>I have been a contract programmer in London for 18 years. What I love most about contracting work is the flexibility it gives me. Sometimes I will finish one contract on a Friday and start the next one on the following Monday. Other times I might take a few months off to visit New Zealand with my wife (we both grew up in New Zealand and all our family are there) or do some other travelling. On a couple of occasions I’ve taken even longer “sabbatical” breaks. They have given me a chance to get away from work altogether and focus on other things. I call them sabbatical breaks because invariably I find myself keen to do some sort of personal development, like get Microsoft Certification, or learn a new technology. </p>
