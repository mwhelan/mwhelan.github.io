AngularJS seems to be getting a lot of momentum at the moment and I think it is going to be a really useful thing to know. We have several “meet up” groups for it here in London and I’ve noticed a lot more jobs requiring it. I am currently learning Angular through [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com/). I [blogged recently](http://www.michael-whelan.net/doing-fewd-with-thinkful/) about the great experience I had with their Front-End Web Development course, and I'm already impressed with the depth of coverage of this course. It doesn’t just cover Angular, but also gets into testing – something I am a huge fan of – and build tools like Gulp and Bower.

I normally blog about C# and things I have a lot of experience with but I thought it might be interesting to blog about AngularJS while I am learning it. All the code I write for the course will be on GitHub so why not try to learn in the open?
