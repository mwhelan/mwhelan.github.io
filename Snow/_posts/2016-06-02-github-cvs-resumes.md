I just discovered that Github can automatically generate a CV/resume for its users based on the public information in their GitHub account. You have to opt-in by going to their [GitHub project](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com) page and starring the project. Check out mine at [http://resume.github.com/?mwhelan](http://resume.github.com/?mwhelan). What a clever idea!
